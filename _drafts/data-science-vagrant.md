- set technical context (e.g., why virtual machine?, why vagrant? what is a virtual machine?, what does vagrant do?)
- what are other alternatives and how do they compare?

- what's the problem? who has the problem? how does this help solve it?
-- O/S is out of date and can't handle certain things
-- new Metis students
-- want to teach your friend Python / onboarding a new team members
- what are some downsides?
-- forgetting to add new packages/libraries to bootstrap script
-- less memory available?
- consistency - can easily switch O/S and still run your code
- compatibility issues (e.g., issues with existing O/S or currently installed packages/dependencies)
- faster startup time
- customizable to your needs
- easy to experiment (e.g., python 2 -> python 3)
- version controlled
- safer (i.e., if your computer ever dies)
- less error-prone (minimizes manual entry)
- less having to deal with the command line to install things
- prerequirements
- can still edit on local machine
- useful when starting new projects and want to keep everything consistent

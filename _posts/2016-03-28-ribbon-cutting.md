Thanks for stopping by! I'm excited to share my Metis NYC Data Science Bootcamp journey to becoming a data scientist. In this "Ribbon Cutting" post, I'll give you some background on myself, explain what Data Science is, tell you about my motivation for doing the Bootcamp, and explain some of details of the Bootcamp. Once I start the Bootcamp, I'm planning to write a new post about every two weeks. Along the way, I'll fill you in on...


- The Metis Data Science Bootcamp experience
- Tips for becoming a Jedi-level Data Scientists (or just using Data Science techniques in your current position)
- The NYC experience (including where to get the best milk shake)

**About Me**

For those that don't know me, perhaps some background on my experience and how I see the world would be useful. At my core, I consider myself a technology "Maker." I am passionate about creating technology products with my strong blend of technical and business skills. I'm born and raised in the DC Metro area and attended UVA where I graduated with a degree in Systems Engineering. Since graduating UVA in 2009, I've worked for Deloitte Consulting in Washington, DC, focusing on technology product development, enterprise architecture, and business intelligence. I also enjoy sports / exercise, travel, cooking/eating, reading, listening to podcasts, and most importantly, learning new things!

**So...why am I doing this?**

I enjoy it

**The Program**

The Bootcamp is in-person in NYC for 12 weeks, Monday through Friday, from 9 am - 6 pm. Going into the Bootcamp, they expect you to have experience writing code and studying/using statistics. The application process (online application, coding challenge, and Skype interview) helps control for these prerequisites.

Highlights of the curriculum include learning the Data Science toolkit, statistical methods such as regression analysis, machine learning, and data visualization with D3. The program culminates in a 3-week final project that allows you to develop a solution to a problem of your choosing. Here's the [full syllabus](http://www.thisismetis.com/documents/Data-Science-Curriculum.pdf){:target="_blank"}

At the end of the program, the goal is to be "comfortable designing, implementing, and communicating the results of a data science project, including knowing the fundamentals of data visualization and having introductory exposure to modern big data tools and architecture such as the Hadoop stack."
